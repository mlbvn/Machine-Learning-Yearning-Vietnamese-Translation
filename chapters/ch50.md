> # 50. Choosing pipeline components: Data availability

> When building a non-end-to-end pipeline system, what are good candidates for the components of the pipeline? How you design the pipeline will greatly impact the overall systemâ€™s performance. One important factor is whether you can easily collect data to train each of the components.

> You can use machine learning to detect cars and pedestrians. Further, it is not hard to obtain data for these: There are numerous computer vision datasets with large numbers of labeled cars and pedestrians. You can also use crowdsourcing (such as Amazon Mechanical Turk) to obtain even larger datasets. It is thus relatively easy to obtain training data to build a car detector and a pedestrian detector.

> To train this system, we would need a large dataset of (Image, Steering Direction) pairs. It is very time-consuming and expensive to have people drive cars around and record their steering direction to collect such data. You need a fleet of specially-instrumented cars, and a huge amount of driving to cover a wide range of possible scenarios. This makes an end-to-end system difficult to train. It is much easier to obtain a large dataset of labeled car or pedestrian images.

> More generally, if there is a lot of data available for training "intermediate modules" of a pipeline (such as a car detector or a pedestrian detector), then you might consider using a pipeline with multiple stages. This structure could be superior because you could use all that available data to train the intermediate modules.

> Until more end-to-end data becomes available, I believe the non-end-to-end approach is significantly more promising for autonomous driving: Its architecture better matches the availability of data.
