# General form of Optimization Verification test

->


You can apply the Optimization Verification test when, given some input ​*x​*, you know how to compute Score​<sub>x</sub>​(*y​*) that indicates how good a response ​*y​* is to an input ​*x*.​ Furthermore, you are using an approximate algorithm to try to find arg max​<sub>y</sub>​ Score​<sub>x</sub>​(*y​*), but suspect that the search algorithm is sometimes failing to find the maximum. In our previous speech recognition example, ​*x=A​* was an audio clip, and ​*y=S​* was the output transcript.

Suppose y* is the “correct” output but the algorithm instead outputs y​<sub>out</sub>​. Then the key test is out​ o measure whether Score​ (y*) > Score​ (y​ ). If this inequality holds, then we blame the x​ x​ out​ optimization algorithm for the mistake. Refer to the previous chapter to make sure you understand the logic behind this. Otherwise, we blame the computation of Score​ (y). x​
