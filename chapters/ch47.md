> Suppose you want to build a system to examine online product reviews and automatically tell you if the writer liked or disliked that product. For example, you hope to recognize the following review as highly positive:

-> _start your translation RIGHT AFTER this line_
> This is a great mop!

-> _start your translation RIGHT AFTER this line_
> and the following as highly negative:

-> _start your translation RIGHT AFTER this line_
> This mop is low quality--I regret buying it.

> The problem of recognizing positive vs. negative opinions is called “sentiment classification.” To build this system, you might build a “pipeline” of two components:

> 1. Parser: A system that annotates the text with information identifying the most important words.[15] For example, you might use the parser to label all the adjectives and nouns. You would therefore get the following annotated text:

-> _start your translation RIGHT AFTER this line_
> This is a great<sub>Adjective</sub> mop<sub>Noun</sub>!

-> _start your translation RIGHT AFTER this line_
> 2. Sentiment classifier: A learning algorithm that takes as input the annotated text and predicts the overall sentiment. The parser’s annotation could help this learning algorithm greatly: By giving adjectives a higher weight, your algorithm will be able to quickly hone in on the important words such as “great,” and ignore less important words such as “this.”

> There has been a recent trend toward replacing pipeline systems with a single learning algorithm. An ​**end-to-end learning algorithm​** for this task would simply take as input the raw, original text “This is a great mop!”, and try to directly recognize the sentiment:

> Neural networks are commonly used in end-to-end learning systems. The term “end-to-end” refers to the fact that we are asking the learning algorithm to go directly from the input to the desired output. I.e., the learning algorithm directly connects the “input end” of the system to the “output end.”

> In problems where data is abundant, end-to-end systems have been remarkably successful. But they are not always a good choice. The next few chapters will give more examples of end-to-end systems as well as give advice on when you should and should not use them.

> **FOOTNOTE:**

> [15]  parser gives a much richer annotation of the text than this, but this simplified description will suffice for explaining end-to-end deep learning.
