# Plotting training error

->

Your dev set (and test set) error should decrease as the training set size grows. But your training set error usually ​*increases​* as the training set size grows.

->


Let’s illustrate this effect with an example. Suppose your training set has only 2 examples: One cat image and one non-cat image. Then it is easy for the learning algorithms to “memorize” both examples in the training set, and get 0% training set error. Even if either or both of the training examples were mislabeled, it is still easy for the algorithm to memorize both labels.

->


Now suppose your training set has 100 examples. Perhaps even a few examples are mislabeled, or ambiguous—some images are very blurry, so even humans cannot tell if there is a cat. Perhaps the learning algorithm can still “memorize” most or all of the training set, but it is now harder to obtain 100% accuracy. By increasing the training set from 2 to 100 examples, you will find that the training set accuracy will drop slightly.

->


Finally, suppose your training set has 10,000 examples. In this case, it becomes even harder for the algorithm to perfectly fit all 10,000 examples, especially if some are ambiguous or mislabeled. Thus, your learning algorithm will do even worse on this training set.

Let’s add a plot of training error to our earlier figures:

You can see that the blue “training error” curve increases with the size of the training set. Furthermore, your algorithm usually does better on the training set than on the dev set; thus the red dev error curve usually lies strictly above the blue training error curve.

Let’s discuss next how to interpret these plots.
