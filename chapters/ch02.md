# Why Machine Learning Strategy

->



After finishing this book, you will have a deep understanding of how to set technical direction for a machine learning project.
->



But your teammates might not understand why you’re recommending a particular direction.
->



Perhaps you want your team to define a single-number evaluation metric, but they aren’t convinced. How do you persuade them?
->



That’s why I made the chapters short: So that you can print them out and get your teammates to read just the 1-2 pages you need them to know.
->



A few changes in prioritization can have a huge effect on your team’s productivity. 
->



By helping your team with a few such changes, I hope that you can become the superhero of your team!
