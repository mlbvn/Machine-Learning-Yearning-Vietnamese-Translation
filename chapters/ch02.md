# Why Machine Learning Strategy

->



After finishing this book, you will have a deep understanding of how to set technical direction for a machine learning project.
-> Sau khi hoàn thành cuốn sách này, bạn sẽ hiểu rõ về cách thiết lập hướng đi khi xây dựng một dự án Machine Learning



But your teammates might not understand why you’re recommending a particular direction.
-> Nhưng đồng đội của bạn có thể không hiểu tại sao bạn cho ra những chiến lược như thế



Perhaps you want your team to define a single-number evaluation metric, but they aren’t convinced. How do you persuade them?
-> Có thể bạn muốn team của bạn định nghĩa 



That’s why I made the chapters short: So that you can print them out and get your teammates to read just the 1-2 pages you need them to know.
->



A few changes in prioritization can have a huge effect on your team’s productivity. 
->



By helping your team with a few such changes, I hope that you can become the superhero of your team!
