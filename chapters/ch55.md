> # 55. General case of error attribution

--> _replace THIS LINE by your translation for the above line_

> Here are the general steps for error attribution. Suppose the pipeline has three steps A, B and C, where A feeds directly into B, and B feeds directly into C.

> 1. Try manually modifying A’s output to be a "perfect" output (e.g., the "perfect" bounding box for the cat), and run the rest of the pipeline B, C on this output. If the algorithm now gives a correct output, then this shows that, if only A had given a better output, the overall algorithm’s output would have been correct; thus, you can attribute this error to component A. Otherwise, go on to Step 2.

> Following the procedure described above, suppose you test out your car on a closed track and find a case where the car chooses a more jarring steering direction than a skilled driver would. In the self-driving world, such a case is usually called a ​**scenario​**. You would then:

> 1. Try manually modifying A (detecting cars)’s output to be a "perfect" output (e.g., manually go in and tell it where the other cars are). Run the rest of the pipeline B, C as before, but allow C (plan path) to use A’s now perfect output. If the algorithm now plans a much better path for the car, then this shows that, if only A had given a better output, the overall algorithm’s output would have been better; Thus, you can attribute this error to component A. Otherwise, go on to Step 2.

> The components of an ML pipeline should be ordered according to a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), meaning that you should be able to compute them in some fixed left-to-right order, and later components should depend only on earlier components’ outputs. So long as the mapping of the components to the A->B->C order follows the DAG ordering, then the error analysis will be fine. You might get slightly different results if you swap A and B:
