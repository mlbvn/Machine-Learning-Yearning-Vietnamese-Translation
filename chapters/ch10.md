# Having a dev set and metric speeds up iterations
->

It is very difficult to know in advance what approach will work best for a new problem. Even experienced machine learning researchers will usually try out many dozens of ideas before they discover something satisfactory. When building a machine learning system, I will often:
->

1. Start off with some ​**idea​** on how to build the system.
->

2. Implement the idea in ​**code​**.
->

3. Carry out an ​**experiment​** which tells me how well the idea worked. (Usually my first few ideas don’t work!) Based on these learnings, go back to generate more ideas, and keep on iterating.

This is an iterative process. The faster you can go round this loop, the faster you will make progress. This is why having dev/test sets and a metric are important: Each time you try an idea, measuring your idea’s performance on the dev set lets you quickly decide if you’re heading in the right direction.

In contrast, suppose you don’t have a specific dev set and metric. So each time your team develops a new cat classifier, you have to incorporate it into your app, and play with the app for a few hours to get a sense of whether the new classifier is an improvement. This would be incredibly slow! Also, if your team improves the classifier’s accuracy from 95.0% to 95.1%, you might not be able to detect that 0.1% improvement from playing with the app. Yet a lot of progress in your system will be made by gradually accumulating dozens of these 0.1% improvements. Having a dev set and metric allows you to very quickly detect which ideas are successfully giving you small (or large) improvements, and therefore lets you quickly decide what ideas to keep refining, and which ones to discard.
