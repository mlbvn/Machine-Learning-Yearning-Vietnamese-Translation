# Your dev and test sets should come from the same distribution

You have your cat app image data segmented into four regions, based on your largest markets: (i) US, (ii) China, (iii) India, and (iv) Other. To come up with a dev set and a test set, say we put US and India in the dev set; China and Other in the test set. In other words, we can randomly assign two of these segments to the dev set, and the other two to the test set, right?

->

Once you define the dev and test sets, your team will be focused on improving dev set performance. Thus, the dev set should reflect the task you want to improve on the most: To do well on all four geographies, and not only two.

->

There is a second problem with having different dev and test set distributions: There is a chance that your team will build something that works well on the dev set, only to find that it does poorly on the test set. I’ve seen this result in much frustration and wasted effort. Avoid letting this happen to you.

->

As an example, suppose your team develops a system that works well on the dev set but not the test set. If your dev and test sets had come from the same distribution, then you would have a very clear diagnosis of what went wrong: You have overfit the dev set. The obvious cure is to get more dev set data.

->

But if the dev and test sets come from different distributions, then your options are less clear. Several things could have gone wrong:

->

1. You had overfit to the dev set.

->

2. The test set is harder than the dev set. So your algorithm might be doing as well as could be expected, and no further significant improvement is possible.

->

3. The test set is not necessarily harder, but just different, from the dev set. So what works well on the dev set just does not work well on the test set. In this case, a lot of your work to improve dev set performance might be wasted effort.

-> 

Working on machine learning applications is hard enough. Having mismatched dev and test sets introduces additional uncertainty about whether improving on the dev set distribution also improves test set performance. Having mismatched dev and test sets makes it harder to figure out what is and isn’t working, and thus makes it harder to prioritize what to work on.

->

If you are working on a 3rd party benchmark problem, their creator might have specified dev and test sets that come from different distributions. Luck, rather than skill, will have a greater impact on your performance on such benchmarks compared to if the dev and test sets come from the same distribution. It is an important research problem to develop learning algorithms that are trained on one distribution and generalize well to another. But if your goal is to make progress on a specific machine learning application rather than make research progress, I recommend trying to choose dev and test sets that are drawn from the same distribution. This will make your team more efficient.
