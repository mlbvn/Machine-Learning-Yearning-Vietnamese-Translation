# How big should the Eyeball and Blackbox dev sets be?

Your Eyeball dev set should be large enough to give you a sense of your algorithm’s major error categories. If you are working on a task that humans do well (such as recognizing cats in images), here are some rough guidelines:
->


* An eyeball dev set in which your classifier makes 10 mistakes would be considered very small. With just 10 errors, it’s hard to accurately estimate the impact of different error categories. But if you have very little data and cannot afford to put more into the Eyeball dev set, it​’​s better than nothing and will help with project prioritization.
->


* If your classifier makes ~20 mistakes on eyeball dev examples, you would start to get a rough sense of the major error sources.
->


* With ~50 mistakes, you would get a good sense of the major error sources.
->


* With ~100 mistakes, you would get a very good sense of the major sources of errors. I’ve seen people manually analyze even more errors—sometimes as many as 500. There is no harm in this as long as you have enough data.
->


Say your classifier has a 5% error rate. To make sure you have ~100 misclassified examples in the Eyeball dev set, the Eyeball dev set would have to have about 2,000 examples (since 0.05*2,000 = 100). The lower your classifier’s error rate, the larger your Eyeball dev set needs to be in order to get a large enough set of errors to analyze.
->


If you are working on a task that even humans cannot do well, then the exercise of examining an Eyeball dev set will not be as helpful because it is harder to figure out why the algorithm didn’t classify an example correctly. In this case, you might omit having an Eyeball dev set. We discuss guidelines for such problems in a later chapter.

How about the Blackbox dev set? We previously said that dev sets of around 1,000-10,000 examples are common. To refine that statement, a Blackbox dev set of 1,000-10,000 examples will often give you enough data to tune hyperparameters and select among models, though there is little harm in having even more data. A Blackbox dev set of 100 would be small but still useful.
->


If you have a small dev set, then you might not have enough data to split into Eyeball and Blackbox dev sets that are both large enough to serve their purposes. Instead, your entire dev set might have to be used as the Eyeball dev set—i.e., you would manually examine all the dev set data.
->


Between the Eyeball and Blackbox dev sets, I consider the Eyeball dev set more important (assuming that you are working on a problem that humans can solve well and that examining the examples helps you gain insight). If you only have an Eyeball dev set, you can perform error analyses, model selection and hyperparameter tuning all on that set. The downside of having only an Eyeball dev set is that the risk of overfitting the dev set is greater.
->


If you have plentiful access to data, then the size of the Eyeball dev set would be determined mainly by how many examples you have time to manually analyze. For example, I’ve rarely seen anyone manually analyze more than 1,000 errors.
