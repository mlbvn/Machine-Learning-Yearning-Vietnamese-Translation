# Optimizing and satisficing metrics

->

Here’s another way to combine multiple evaluation metrics.

->

Suppose you care about both the accuracy and the running time of a learning algorithm. You need to choose from these three classifiers:

->

| Classifier  | Accuracy | Running time |
| ----- | -------: | -------: |
| A  | 90%  | 80ms |
| B  | 92%  | 95ms |
| C  | 95%  | 1,500ms |

It seems unnatural to derive a single metric by putting accuracy and running time into a single formula, such as:

->

Accuracy - 0.5*RunningTime

->

Here’s what you can do instead: First, define what is an “acceptable” running time. Lets say anything that runs in 100ms is acceptable. Then, maximize accuracy, subject to your classifier meeting the running time criteria. Here, running time is a “satisficing metric”—your classifier just has to be “good enough” on this metric, in the sense that it should take at most 100ms. Accuracy is the “optimizing metric.”

->

If you are trading off N different criteria, such as binary file size of the model (which is important for mobile apps, since users don’t want to download large apps), running time, and accuracy, you might consider setting N-1 of the criteria as “satisficing” metrics. I.e., you simply require that they meet a certain value. Then define the final one as the “optimizing” metric. For example, set a threshold for what is acceptable for binary file size and running time, and try to optimize accuracy given those constraints.

As a final example, suppose you are building a hardware device that uses a microphone to listen for the user saying a particular “wakeword,” that then causes the system to wake up. Examples include Amazon Echo listening for “Alexa”; Apple Siri listening for “Hey Siri”; Android listening for “Okay Google”; and Baidu apps listening for “Hello Baidu.” You care about both the false positive rate—the frequency with which the system wakes up even when no one said the wakeword—as well as the false negative rate—how often it fails to wake up when someone says the wakeword. One reasonable goal for the performance of this system is to minimize the false negative rate (optimizing metric), subject to there being no more than one false positive every 24 hours of operation (satisficing metric).

->

Once your team is aligned on the evaluation metric to optimize, they will be able to make faster progress.
