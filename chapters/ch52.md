> An image classification algorithm will input an image ​x,​ and output an integer indicating the object category. Can an algorithm instead output an entire sentence describing the image?

> Traditional applications of supervised learning learned a function ​*h:​ ​X​→​Y*,​ where the output y​ was usually an integer or a real number. For example:

> One of the most exciting developments in end-to-end deep learning is that it is letting us directly learn ​*y​* that are much more complex than a number. In the image-captioning example above, you can have a neural network input an image (​*x*)​ and directly output a caption (​*y​*).

> This is an accelerating trend in deep learning: When you have the right (input,output) labeled pairs, you can sometimes learn end-to-end even when the output is a sentence, an image, audio, or other outputs that are richer than a single number.
