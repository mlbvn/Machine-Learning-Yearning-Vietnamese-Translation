# Interpreting learning curves: High bias
->

Suppose your dev error curve looks like this:
->

We previously said that, if your dev error curve plateaus, you are unlikely to achieve the desired performance just by adding data.
->

But it is hard to know exactly what an extrapolation of the red dev error curve will look like. If the dev set was small, you would be even less certain because the curves could be noisy.
->

Suppose we add the training error curve to this plot and get the following:
->

Now, you can be absolutely sure that adding more data will not, by itself, be sufficient. Why is that? Remember our two observations:
->

* As we add more training data, training error can only get worse. Thus, the blue training error curve can only stay the same or go higher, and thus it can only get further away from the (green line) level of desired performance.
->


* The red dev error curve is usually higher than the blue training error. Thus, there’s almost no way that adding more data would allow the red dev error curve to drop down to the desired level of performance when even the training error is higher than the desired level of performance.
->


Examining both the dev error curve and the training error curve on the same plot allows us to more confidently extrapolate the dev error curve.
->


Suppose, for the sake of discussion, that the desired performance is our estimate of the optimal error rate. The figure above is then the standard “textbook” example of what a learning curve with high avoidable bias looks like: At the largest training set size—presumably corresponding to all the training data we have—there is a large gap between the training error and the desired performance, indicating large avoidable bias. Furthermore, the gap between the training and dev curves is small, indicating small variance.

Previously, we were measuring training and dev set error only at the rightmost point of this plot, which corresponds to using all the available training data. Plotting the full learning curve gives us a more comprehensive picture of the algorithms’ performance on different training set sizes.
